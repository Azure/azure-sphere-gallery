## Prerequisites

This sample requires the following hardware:

- An [Azure Sphere development board](https://aka.ms/azurespheredevkits).

## Setup

1. Ensure that your Azure Sphere device is connected to your computer and your computer is connected to the internet.
1. Even if you've performed this setup previously, ensure that you have Azure Sphere SDK version 21.07 or above. At the command prompt, run **azsphere show-version** to check. Upgrade the Azure Sphere SDK for [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/install-sdk) or [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/install-sdk-linux) as needed.
1. Enable application development, if you have not already done so, by entering the following line at the command prompt:

   `azsphere device enable-development`
1. Configure networking on your device. You must either [set up WiFi](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/configure-wifi#set-up-wi-fi-on-your-azure-sphere-device) or [set up Ethernet](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/network/connect-ethernet) on your development board, depending on the type of network connection you are using.
## Running the code

When the app is run, by default the app will print the MAC and IP address of the WiFi interface.

To change the interface to ethernet, search for the line `static const char networkInterface[] = "wlan0";` and change it to `static const char networkInterface[] = "eth0";`, compile and run the app.
