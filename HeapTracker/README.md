# Heap Tracker library

HeapTracker is a thin-layer library that implements a custom heap tracking mechanism which provides a global `heap_allocated` variable that can be used track the memory requests being done by the High-level application. The library accomplishes this by overriding the following native C memory allocation functions, though the standard GNU C Library wrapping mechanism:
- `malloc()`, `realloc()`, `calloc()`, `alloc_aligned()` and `free()`

| [log.h](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/applibs-log/log-overview) | Contains functions that log debug messages. |

## Prerequisites & Setup

- An Azure Sphere-based device with development features (see [Get started with Azure Sphere](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-sphere/get-started/) for more information).
- Setup a development environment for Azure Sphere (see [Quickstarts to set up your Azure Sphere device](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/install/overview) for more information).

## How to use

1. The following two options must be added to the `target_link_libraries` option in CMakeLists.txt:

    ```cmake
    -Wl,--wrap=malloc -Wl,--wrap=realloc -Wl,--wrap=calloc -Wl,--wrap=alloc_aligned -Wl,--wrap=free
    ```
    For example, in `CMakeLists.txt`:

    ```cmake
    ...
    target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} applibs pthread gcc_s c -Wl,--wrap=malloc -Wl,--wrap=realloc -Wl,--wrap=calloc -Wl,--wrap=alloc_aligned -Wl,--wrap=free)
    ...
    ```

2. In the library's header file `heap_tracker_lib.h`, define wither verbose logs are enabled or not by setting `DEBUG_LOGS_ON` accordingly:

    ```c
    //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // GLOBAL VARIABLES
    //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    #define DEBUG_LOGS_ON	1				// Enables(1)/Disables(0) verbose loggging
    extern const size_t		heap_threshold;	// Sets a reference allocation threshold (in bytes) after which the library will log warnings.
    extern volatile ssize_t	heap_allocated;	// Currently allocated heap (in bytes). Note: this is NOT thread safe!
    ```

3. In the library's implementation file `heap_tracker_lib.c`, define an initial value for the `heap_threshold` constant. Please refer to [Memory available on Azure Sphere](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/app-development/mt3620-memory-available) for more information on memory availability for High-level applications.

4. Use the `malloc()`, `calloc()` and `alloc_aligned()` functions as usual in your App, **with the exception of `free()` and `realloc()`**, instead of which the `_free()` and `_realloc()` helpers **must** be used, in order to keep correct tracking within the `heap_allocated` variable. If the native `free()` and `realloc()` functions were to be used in the App, the `heap_allocated` variable cannot be considered reliable anymore.

5. Track and monitor the `heap_allocated` value.

## Example

The sample code in `main.c` will cyclicly grow in heap memory allocation by calling *consumeHeap_malloc* or *consumeHeap_realloc* (depending on what's uncommented in the `main()` preprocessor block), and fetch the remaining free heap memory up to the limit that has been set in the `heap_threshold` variable:

- On success, *getFreeHeapMemory_malloc* or *consumeHeap_realloc* return the amount of memory (in bytes) successfully allocated by the incremental malloc()/realloc() attempts, up to the given `heap_threshold`. If `DEBUG_LOGS_ON` is set to `1` (in `heap_tracker_lib.h`), the following output will be generated:

    ```c
    Remote debugging from host 192.168.35.1, port 60851
    Starting Heap Tracker test application...
    consumeHeap_malloc --> Heap status: max available(256000 bytes), allocated (0 bytes)
    Heap-Tracker lib: malloc(1024)=0xbeee9010... SUCCESS: heap_allocated (1024 bytes) - delta with heap_threshold(254976 bytes)
    Heap-Tracker lib: _free(0xbeee9010,1024)... SUCCESS: heap_allocated (0 bytes) - delta with heap_threshold(256000 bytes)
    Heap-Tracker lib: malloc(2048)=0xbee7b3e0... SUCCESS: heap_allocated (2048 bytes) - delta with heap_threshold(253952 bytes)
    ...
    ...
    Heap-Tracker lib: _free(0xbedcf010,256000)... SUCCESS: heap_allocated (0 bytes) - delta with heap_threshold(256000 bytes)
    Heap-Tracker lib: malloc(257024)=0xbedcf010... WARNING: heap_allocated (257024 bytes) is above heap_threshold (256000 bytes)
    Heap-Tracker lib: _free(0xbedcf010,257024)... SUCCESS: heap_allocated (0 bytes) - delta with heap_threshold(256000 bytes)
    consumeHeap_malloc --> Currently available heap up to given heap_threshold: 251Kb (257024 bytes)
    ```

- On failure, the OS's OOM Killer will SIGKILL the App's process. This will be the indicator that the global variable `heap_threshold` in `heap_tracker_lib.c` should be lowered to a value below to the last successful allocation:

    ```c
    Remote debugging from host 192.168.35.1, port 60827
    Starting Heap Tracker test application...
    consumeHeap_realloc --> Heap status: max available(256000 bytes), allocated (0 bytes)
    Heap-Tracker lib: _realloc(0,0,1024)=0xbeee9010... SUCCESS: heap_allocated (1025 bytes) - delta with heap_threshold(254975 bytes)
    Heap-Tracker lib: _realloc(0xbeee9010,1024,2048)=0xbeee9010... SUCCESS: heap_allocated (2050 bytes) - delta with heap_threshold(253950 bytes)
    Heap-Tracker lib: _realloc(0xbeee9010,2048,3072)=0xbeee9010... SUCCESS: heap_allocated (3075 bytes) - delta with heap_threshold(252925 bytes)
    ...
    ...
    Heap-Tracker lib: _realloc(0xbeeff010,189440,190464)=0xbeeff010... SUCCESS: heap_allocated (190650 bytes) - delta with heap_threshold(65350 bytes)
    Heap-Tracker lib: _realloc(0xbeeff010,190464,191488)=0xbeeff010... SUCCESS: heap_allocated (191675 bytes) - delta with heap_threshold(64325 bytes)

    Child terminated with signal = 0x9 (SIGKILL)
    ```

## Key concepts

The goal of the Heap Tracker library, is to support developers track their High-level application's memory requests to match the expected behavior throughout the application execution time (i.e. a constant raise in value of `heap_allocated` may indicate a potential memory leak).

## Next steps
For more information and recommendations on Azure Sphere memory usage and debugging, see [Memory use in high-level applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/app-development/application-memory-usage).

## Project expectations

This library should be used during *development only*, for optimizing the memory usage in a High-level application. It is not recommended to be used productions versions of Apps.
