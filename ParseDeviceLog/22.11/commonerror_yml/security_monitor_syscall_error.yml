#  The errors that are part of the syscall contract are defined here so that the error tooling (specifically
#  error_codes.py in exp23-yocto) will work as expected.  Development practice expects the errors to be found in a YML
#  file and the tooling helps ensure that we don't have overlapping errors. However, the errors that are part of the
#  contract should be defined and used by code in security_monitor.h.  So this file covers the tooling, and code should
#  use security_monitor.h to get the error definitions.
