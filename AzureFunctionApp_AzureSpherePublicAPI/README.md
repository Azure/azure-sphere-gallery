# AzureFunctionApp-AzureSpherePublicAPI project

The goal of this project is to show how to use the Azure Sphere Public API in a Python Azure Function App.

## Prerequisites & Setup

- Setup a development environment for Azure Sphere (see [Quickstarts to set up your Azure Sphere device](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/overview) for more information).
- An Azure Sphere-based device with development features (see [Get started with Azure Sphere](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-sphere/get-started/) for more information).
- One or more Azure Sphere tenants (see [About tenants](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/deployment/about-tenants) for more information).

## How to use

Get started by creating an Azure Function App that supports Python development (see [Quickstart: Create a function in Azure with Python using Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-python) for more information).

Deploy the Python Function App to Azure and test the HttpTrigger is working.

Enable `System Assigned Managed Service Identity` for the Function App by locating your Function App in the Azure Portal, selecting `Identity` and turning on the `System assigned` identity.

Copy the `Object (principal) ID`, you will need this later.

The [Azure Sphere Public API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/azure-sphere) requires an authentication token in REST API calls, the token is obtained through the Function App `Service Principal` which is linked to a user in your Azure Sphere tenant (details on creating the user are below).

You will need the following:
* Azure Sphere device claimed into a tenant
* **Azure Sphere Tenant Id** Use the Azure Sphere command line interface (CLI) and run `azsphere tenant show-selected` (you can also use the `azsphere tenant list` and `azsphere tenant select` commands to select a different tenant).
* **Azure Subscription/Tenant Id** Log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and search for `tenant`, select `tenant properties` and copy the Tenant Id (this will be a GUID)

### Add the Azure Sphere Application to your Azure Tenant (one time setup)

* Open Powershell (in Administrative mode) - and install the Azure AD module (you may need to install the NuGet provider, confirm the warning for *"Untrusted repository"*)

```cmd
Install-Module AzureAD 
```

* Run the following commands (you'll be asked to sign-in):

```cmd
Connect-AzureAD -TenantId <<Your Azure Tenant Id>>
```
Note that the GUID used in the following command is a fixed value and defines the Azure Sphere API Application ID which needs to be added to your tenant.

**Note:** you'll need administrator rights in your Microsoft AD Tenant to run this command.

```cmd
New-AzureADServicePrincipal -AppId 7c209960-a417-423c-b2e3-9251907e63fe -DisplayName "Azure Sphere API"
```

### Register the `Service Principal` user in the Azure Sphere tenant.

You will need:

* Your Azure Sphere Tenant Id `azsphere tenant show-selected`
* The Function App Managed Service Identity `Object (principal) ID`
* Your Azure Active Directory Tenant Id (Guid)

Use the following commands to register a new user in your Azure Sphere tenant.

Here's a key to the commands below:

| Item | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| tttttttt-tttt-tttt-tttt-tttttttttttt | Azure Sphere Tenant Id |
| xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx | Function App's `Object (principal) ID` |
| zzzzzzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzzzzzzzzzz | Azure Tenant Id |


```cmd
azsphere login
azsphere tenant select --tenantid tttttttt-tttt-tttt-tttt-tttttttttttt
azsphere register-user --new-user  xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx@zzzzzzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzzzzzzzzzz.onmicrosoft.com
azsphere role add --role Contributor --user xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx@zzzzzzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzzzzzzzzzz.onmicrosoft.com
```

### Modify the Azure Function App project and Deploy to Azure

Replace the existing Python Function app code `__init__.py` with this updated [project code](./src/__init__.py).

Replace the `YOUR_FUNCTION_APP_SYSTEM_ASSIGNED_MANAGED_IDENTITY` with the Function App Managed Service Identity `Object (principal) ID`

Modify the Function App `requirements.txt` to add azure.identity and requests:

```python
# DO NOT include azure-functions-worker in this file
# The Python Worker is managed by Azure Functions platform
# Manually managing azure-functions-worker may cause unexpected issues

azure-functions
azure.identity
requests
```

Save and deploy the updated Python Function app to Azure.

**Testing the updated Azure Function App**

Open the Azure Function app in the Azure Portal, select `Code + Test` and then click `Get function URL`, copy the url to the clipboard, open a web browser and paste the url and hit `Enter`.

![Test Function App](assets/TestFunctionApp.png)

 When the web page loads you should see text similar to the following:

```cmd
Function triggered ok
b3196be1-9e95-4631-a3c1-83e034eba8f2 your-tenant-name
```
