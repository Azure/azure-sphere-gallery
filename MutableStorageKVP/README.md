# MutableStorageKVP

MutableStorageKVP provides a set of functions that expose Key/Value pair functions (write, read, delete) over Azure Sphere [Mutable Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/app-development/storage#using-mutable-storage).

## Contents

| File/folder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `src`       | Header and Source file for MutableStorageKVP |
| `README.md` | This README file. |
| `LICENSE.txt`   | The license for the project. |

## Prerequisites & Setup

You will need an Azure Sphere development board, Visual Studio/Visual Studio Code, and the latest Azure Sphere SDK.

Your Azure Sphere development board will need development enabled `azsphere device enable-development`

## How to use

The header exposes three APIs:


`bool WriteProfileString(char *keyName, char *value);`

`ssize_t GetProfileString(char *keyName, char *returnedString, size_t Size);`

`bool DeleteProfileString(char *keyName);`

To use these functions you will need to allocate some Mutable Storage space for your application, this can be set in your projects `app_manifest.json` (example below).

```json
{
  "SchemaVersion": 1,
  "Name": "Sample",
  "ComponentId": "96CD41BD-A649-4982-86EC-DFDA354D524C",
  "EntryPoint": "/bin/app",
  "Capabilities": {
    "MutableStorage": {
      "SizeKB": 32
    }
  },
  "ApplicationType": "Default"
}
```

Using the functions is fairly straight forward, let's query for a non-existent Key/Value pair, create a Key/Value Pair, read the Key/Value pair, then delete the Key/Value pair.

```cpp

    char buffer[20];
    ssize_t valueLength = 0;

    // Delete Mutable file to start clean.
    // #include <applibs/storage.h>
    Storage_DeleteMutableFile();

    // try to read a key/value that does not exist.
    valueLength = GetProfileString("Foo", &buffer[0], 20);
    if (valueLength == -1) {
        Log_Debug("The Key/Value pair 'Foo' doesn't exist\n");
    }

    // Create the Key/Value Pair
    bool writeOK = WriteProfileString("Foo", "Bar");
    if (!writeOK) {
        Log_Debug("Failed to Write Key/Value Pair\n");
    }

    // Now read the value we've just written
    valueLength = GetProfileString("Foo", &buffer[0], 20);
    if (valueLength != -1) {
        Log_Debug("Foo:%s\n", buffer);
    }

    // Now delete the Key Value Pair.
    bool deleteOk = DeleteProfileString("Foo");
    if (!deleteOk) {
        Log_Debug("Failed to delete key\n");
    }

```

Your application will need to `#include "MutableStorageKVP.h`, and your CMakeLists.txt will need to include `MutableStorageKVP.c` and `cJSON\cJSON.c`

The functions only deal with strings, you can easily wrap other variable types by converting to/from string.

## Project expectations

* This is a set of helper functions for developers; it is not official, maintained, or production-ready code.
* This sample has not been written to consider flash wear issues.

### Expected support for the code

This code is not formally maintained, but we will make a best effort to respond to/address any issues you encounter.

### How to report an issue

If you run into an issue with this code, please open a GitHub issue against this repo.
