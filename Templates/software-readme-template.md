## Prerequisites

<!---List the components and tools required to build and run the project. Include OS platform, any tools, minimum Azure Sphere OS/SDK versions, etc. Include links to required items wherever possible. If lists are long, suggest separating hardware from software.
--->

  - Windows/Linux version
  - Visual Studio/VSCode version
  - Azure Sphere OS and/or SDK version xxx
  - Any specific Azure Sphere hardware?
  - Other hardware?
  - Azure subscription, Azure IoT setup, etc.?


## Setup

<!--- Explain how to prepare the project after it's been downloaded: how to install any dependencies and configure any settings? e.g. setup of an Azure IoT Hub would go here. --->

## Running the code

<Stepwise instructions for building and running the software.>

## Key concepts

Discuss the aspects of the project that might be particularly useful to someone looking at it:

- Significant design decisions
- Gotchas and tricky bits
- Opportunities for customization

## Next steps

<!---Next steps for users to learn more about the technology, how to revise the project to do other interesting things, etc. Don't reiterate the online documentation here; link to it if necessary. --->

## Project expectations

Describe the state of the code. For example:

* The code is not secure (for example, connection strings are included in the code).
* The code is grossly inefficient (for example, loops that run unnecessarily because it uses the wrong breakout points).
* The code does not run (for example, there are build errors).
* The code may cause a problem if used in a production scenario.
* The code has not been run through a complete security analysis (for example, there are static analysis failures).

### Expected support for the code

<!---If you will reply to issues, please suggest how users should report problems or reach out. Github issues is preferable.--->

How often will you check and reply to issues or maintain and update the code? For example:
* Will reply to issues once per quarter, once a year, etc.
* No support whatsoever, code is as is

## Telemetry collection
