## Prerequisites & Setup

You should have at least one [Azure Sphere tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/deployment/create-tenant), and one or more devices claimed into your tenant.

You should clone the Azure IoT sample from the [Azure Sphere Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sphere-samples) Github Repository.

Follow the instructions to [setup an Azure IoT Central application](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sphere-samples/blob/master/Samples/AzureIoT/IoTCentral.md)

## How to use

SetIoTCentralPropsForDeviceGroup is a console application, the application takes four command line arguments: 

| Command | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `Azure IoT Central App URL`       | example: https://myapp.azureiotcentral.com |
| `Azure IoT Central API Token` | [Create an API token in the IoT Central App](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-central/core/overview-iot-central-tour#administration) |
| `Azure Sphere Device group guid`   | The guid of the Azure Sphere Device Group to update |
| `JSON Setting to apply`       | example: {"StatusLED":true} |

To obtain the Azure Sphere Device Group ID you can:
* Determine the list of Azure Sphere tenants you have access to `azsphere tenant list`
* Select the tenant `azsphere tenant select -i {guid of tenant}`
* Determine the list of products within the tenant `azsphere product list`
* Determine the list of device groups within a product `azsphere product device-group list --productname <product name>`
* You can move a device into a device group using this command `azsphere device update --devicegroupid <guid> -i <device id>`

### Checklist - Make sure you have:
1. A device that's claimed into your Azure Sphere tenant
2. You have created a Product, and Device Groups (default device groups are ok)
3. Your device has been selected into one of the device groups
4. You have cloned the Azure IoT Sample from Github
5. You have created the Azure IoT Central application
6. You have run ShowIoTCentralConfig to obtain the IoT Central Endpoint addresses, and have updated the Azure IoT App_Manifset.json

Make sure you have the four required command line arguments:
* Azure IoT Central app URL
* Azure IoT Central API Token
* Azure Sphere Device Group Guid
* JSON Setting to apply

You can now run the SetIoTCentralPropsForDeviceGroup utility:

A sample command line could look like this:

`SetIoTCentralPropsForDeviceGroup https://myapp.azureiotcentral.com "IoT Central Access Token" 168A1115-568D-4717-A445-CFC4BB1BB8C7 {\"StatusLED\":true}` 

## Potential issues

While working with the community we've documented a couple of potential issues that users may encounter using this sample 

### Issue encountered: Application incorrectly parses JSON argument

You may see this issue if you use the Windows PowerShell application to run the sample.  Try running the sample using the Windows Command Prompt "cmd" application.

### Issue encountered: The sample runs without errors, however the twin property is not updated in the IoTCentral application

Make sure that your device twin properties are defined as an "Interface" in your IoTCentral application.  You can add the standard "Azure Sphere Device Template" to see a working example.
