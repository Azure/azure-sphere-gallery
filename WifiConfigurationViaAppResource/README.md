# Wifi configuration via application resource project

The goal of this project is to show how to configure Wi-Fi settings for a device using an embedded application resource file (JSON).

## Prerequisites & Setup

- An Azure Sphere-based device with development features enabled (see [Get started with Azure Sphere](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-sphere/get-started/) for more information).
- Setup a development environment for Azure Sphere (see [Quickstarts to set up your Azure Sphere device](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/install/overview) for more information).

Note that the Azure Sphere High Level application is configured for the 21.01 SDK release.

## How to use
The application uses an embedded application resource file (WiFiConfig.json), the file contains the SSID and network key used to configure the device.

```json
{
    "ssid": "mySSID",
    "networkKey": "myNetworkKey"
}
```

To read the JSON the application uses the [Storage_OpenFileInImagePackage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/applibs-storage/function-storage-openfileinimagepackage) API, and then  [lseek](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/lseek.2.html), and [read](https://linux.die.net/man/2/read) APIs to read the JSON file - [parson](https://github.com/kgabis/parson) is used as a JSON parser to read the SSID and Network Key.

The sample JSON contains 'mySSID' and 'myNetworkKey', replace these with the SSID and network key that you want to provision on your device.

The application enables the WiFiConfig capability in app_manifest.json.

```json
"WifiConfig": true
```

Note that the project uses `WifiConfig_SetSecurityType` to set the security type to `WifiConfig_Security_Wpa2_Psk` - the API can also take `WifiConfig_Security_Open` and `WifiConfig_Security_Wpa2_EAP_TLS`. The sample will need to be modified to support these other security types.

## Project expectations

* The code has been developed to show how to configure Wi-Fi settings using an embedded JSON application resource - It is not official, maintained, or production-ready code.

### Expected support for the code

This code is not formally maintained, but we will make a best effort to respond to/address any issues you encounter.
