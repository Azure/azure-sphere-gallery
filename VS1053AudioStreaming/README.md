## Prerequisites & Setup

- An Azure Sphere-based device with development features (see [Get started with Azure Sphere](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-sphere/get-started/) for more information).
- Setup a development environment for Azure Sphere (see [Quickstarts to set up your Azure Sphere device](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/install/overview) for more information).

Note that the Azure Sphere High Level application is configured for the 21.04 SDK release.

## How to use

The project supports the Seeed RDB with an [Adafruit VS1053](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1381) board.

Here's the pinout used in the project the Seeed RDB pinout diagram is [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/hardware/mt3620-user-guide))

| AGND | Audio Jack GND | NA |
| ROUT | Audio Jack Right | NA |
| LOUT | Audio Jack Left | NA |

The VS1053 project code exposes four functions:

* **VS1053_Init** to initialize the hardware
* **VS1053_Cleanup** to cleanup SPI and GPIO resources
* **VS1053_SetVolume** to set the volume level (0 is off, 30 is max)
* **VS1053_PlayByte** to play audio data

The project is configured to play an embedded resource audio file, and also supports internet radio streaming. To enable the internet radio stream uncomment the **add_compile_definitions** line in the following block in the CMakeLists.txt file.

```cmake
# ENABLE NPR INTERNET RADIO STREAM ##########################################################################################
#
# add_compile_definitions(ENABLE_RADIO_STREAMING)
#
###################################################################################################################

```
