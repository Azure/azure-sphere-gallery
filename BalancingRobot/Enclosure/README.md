# Balancing Robot Enclosure
 
The Enclosure folder contains the mechanical parts to build the balancing robot. 
 
The Robot design is made in [Solidworks](https://www.solidworks.com/). Locate the main assembly in the Solidworks folder to open the full robot assembly in Solidworks. The file is called: “Balancing_Robot_Assembly_07042020.SLDASM”.  
 
For other CAD software, refer to the .STEP file in the STEP folder or 3D print parts direct using files in the STL folder. The required amount of parts for 1 robot is reflected in the .STL file name.
