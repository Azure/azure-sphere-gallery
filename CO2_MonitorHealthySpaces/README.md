## Why monitor CO2 levels

The COVID-19 pandemic inspired this project. CO2 levels can impact your productivity and mental health. CO2 levels can also indicate how ventilated an area is. Well ventilated shared spaces will be critical as we return to a "new" normal.

### Create safer spaces

Although CO2 levels are not a direct measure of possible exposure to COVID-19, checking levels using a monitor can help you identify poorly ventilated areas.

Learn more about [Ventilation and air conditioning during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic](https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation/identifying-poorly-ventilated-areas.htm).

### Create productive and healthy spaces

When working from home, it's easy to close the door to shut out the noise of everyday life while we get on with work. Closing the door can lead to a build-up of CO2 gas, a by-product of our breathing. High CO2 levels can impact our wellbeing, concentration, and productivity levels.

Learn how [Indoor carbon dioxide levels could be a health hazard, scientists warn](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/08/indoor-carbon-dioxide-levels-could-be-a-health-hazard-scientists-warn).

The problem is we cannot see or smell Carbon Dioxide, it keeps building up, and we have no way of knowing it's happening other than getting tired or a headache.

## Azure Sphere DevX

The CO2 monitoring project uses the community-maintained Azure Sphere DevX library. The focus of the Azure Sphere DevX library is communications and simplification of common scenarios. The library is modular, lightweight, and well tested. The Azure Sphere DevX library will reduce the amount of code you write, improve readability and maintenance. You are free to use the library for your solutions.

### Azure Sphere DevX bindings

Bindings are the fundamental concept of the Azure Sphere DevX library. Bindings allow you to declare elements of a solution. For example, there are bindings for GPIO, PWM, Timers, inter-core messaging, Azure device twins and direct methods, and more.

Here is an example declaring a GPIO binding for an LED.

```c
static DX_GPIO_BINDING gpio_network_led = {
    .pin = NETWORK_CONNECTED_LED,
    .name = "network_led",
    .direction = DX_OUTPUT,
    .initialState = GPIO_Value_Low,
    .invertPin = true
};
```

### Azure Sphere DevX binding functions

Binding functions support bindings. For example, let's control the GPIO binding for the LED.

| binding function  | Purpose   |
|---|---|
| dx_gpioOpen(&gpio_network_led) | Opens the LED |
| dx_gpioOn(&gpio_network_led) | Turns on the LED |
| dx_gpioOff(&gpio_network_led) | Turns off the LED |
| dx_gpioClose(&gpio_network_led) | Closes the LED |

### Azure Sphere DevX naming conventions

All bindings and binding functions are prefixed with **dx_**. Following the prefix, is the name of the binding that is supported. In the above example, the binding functions support GPIO bindings.

### Azure Sphere DevX Examples

For more information about Azure Sphere DevX bindings and binding functions, refer to the [Azure Sphere DevX Examples Wiki](https://github.com/Azure-Sphere-DevX/AzureSphereDevX.Examples/wiki).

## Device drivers

Device drivers can be daunting to start with, but most silicon vendors drivers have a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) where you implement platform-specific support for the driver.

### MikroE BUZZ Click

![Image shows the MikorE BUZZ Click](media/buzz_click.png)

The BUZZ Click piezo speaker alerts you when recorded CO2 levels are above the CO2 alert level.

The BUZZ Click is a Pulse Width Module (PWM) peripheral. You control the tone by changing the PWM frequency and the volume by altering the PWM duty cycle. The piezo speaker is driven at a frequency of 5kHz, with a 1% duty cycle, for ten milliseconds. This combination produces a pip sound, enough to alert you without being too annoying.

This oscilloscope screenshot shows the PWM signal generated to drive the piezo speaker.

![PWM control of BUZZ Click buzzer](media/buzz_click_pwm.png)

### The Sensirion SDC30 CO2 Sensor

![Image shows the Grove CO2, temperature and humidity sensor](media/Grove_CO2_Temperature_Humidity_Sensor.png)

Sensirion, the company that manufactures the SCD30 CO2 sensor in the [Seeed Studio Grove CO2 & Temperature & Humidity Sensor](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-CO2-Temperature-Humidity-Sensor-SCD30-p-2911.html) makes it easy to port their drivers to different platforms, including Azure Sphere.

It was a matter of implementing the I2C init/read/write functions and a microsecond sleep function. The CO2 monitor project includes the ported driver. You can view the driver here [sensirion_hw_i2c_implementation.c](src/embedded-scd/embedded-common/hw_i2c/sensirion_hw_i2c_implementation.c)

#### Calibrating the SCD30 sensor

**IMPORTANT**. Be sure to read calibrating the [Grove - CO2 & Temperature & Humidity Sensor (SCD30) Calibration](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-CO2_Temperature_Humidity_Sensor-SCD30/#calibration) sensor.

This solution enables auto-calibration of the sensor. When scd30 automatic self-calibration (ASC) is activated for the first time, the sensor must remain powered on for at least seven days. The calibration process restarts if the sensor is powered off during these seven days.

This calibration time is needed for the sensor algorithm to calculate its initial parameter set for ASC. The sensor must be exposed to fresh air for at least 1 hour every day.

### The Sensirion SDC41 CO2 Sensor

The MikroE HVAC Click uses the Sensirion SDC41 CO2, Temperature, and humidity sensor. Sensirion, follow the same pattern for the [SDC41 driver](https://github.com/Sensirion/embedded-i2c-scd4x) as the SDC30 sensor, there is a HAL, and it's a matter of implementing Azure Sphere I2C support. The SCD41 driver for Azure Sphere is included in the project. Calibration of the sensor is also required.

![This image shows the MikroE HVAC click](media/hvac-click-thickbox_default-1.jpg)

### Avnet Azure Sphere onboard sensors

![This image shows the layout of the Avnet starter kit](media/avnet_board_layout.png)

The Avnet Azure Sphere starter kit has several onboard sensors, including temperature, pressure, light, and an accelerometer. This solution uses the onboard air pressure and the light sensor.

So, with the CO2 sensor from Sensirion and the Avnet onboard sensors, there are sensors for carbon dioxide, temperature, humidity, pressure, and light.

Drivers for the STM sensors on the Avnet starter kit follow the same pattern as drivers from Sensirion. You need to implement I2C platform_read, platform_write, platform_init, and platform_delay. To review the driver implementation, refer to [imu_temp_pressure.c](src/AzureSphereDrivers/AVNET/HL/imu_temp_pressure.c)

### Light sensor

The solution uses the onboard light sensor. The light sensor is an analog device, and it's read with the Azure Sphere ADC (Analog-to-digital Converter) APIs.

### Driving the LEDs

The easiest way to control LEDs is to treat them as GPIO peripherals. But to be a little bit fancy, the LEDs in the CO2 project are driven using PWM to control their brightness. The ambient light level determines the brightness of the status LED.

## IoT Plug and Play

This solution uses IoT Plug and Play with IoT Central. IoT Plug and Play (PnP) defines a model that a device uses to advertise its capabilities to a PnP-enabled application like IoT Central. PnP is an open specification, to learn more, refer to [What is IoT Plug and Play](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-pnp/overview-iot-plug-and-play).

An IoT Plug and Play CO2 monitor model has been published to the [public repository of IoT Plug and Play](https://github.com/Azure/iot-plugandplay-models) models. A local copy of the IoT Plug and Play model is located in the *iot_plug_and_play* directory.

When your device first connects to IoT Central, the IoT Plug and Play model is retrieved from the public repository of models. IoT Central then creates default views using the Plug and Play model.

The IoT Plug and Play model for the CO2 monitor project is declared in main.h.

```c
#define IOT_PLUG_AND_PLAY_MODEL_ID "dtmi:com:example:azuresphere:co2monitor;1"
```

## IoT Central and Azure Sphere tenant trust

Once your IoT Central application has been created, you must enable trust between your Azure Sphere tenant and your Azure IoT Central application. Trust is enabled by sharing your Azure Sphere tenant Certificate Authority certificate with your IoT Central application.

When trust is enabled, any device claimed into your trusted Azure Sphere tenant will be enrolled when it first connects to IoT Central.

Follow these steps to enable trust.

1. Open a **command prompt**.

2. Log in to your Azure Sphere tenant. From the command prompt, run:

   ```azsphere
   azsphere login
   ```

3. Make a note of the current folder. You'll need the name of this folder in the next step.

4. Download the Azure Sphere tenant certificate authority (CA) certificate. From the command prompt, run:

   ```azsphere
   azsphere ca-certificate download --destination CAcertificate.cer
   ```

### Create an Enrollment Group

1. From the IoT Central web portal, select the hamburger button on the top-left corner of the screen to expand the sidebar menu.

1. Leave group type set to **IoT devices**.
1. Select Certificates (X.509) from the Attestation type dropdown.
1. Select **Save**.

### Upload the Azure Sphere tenant CA certificate to Azure IoT Central

1. Select **+ Manage primary**.

1. Select the folder icon next to the **Primary** box and navigate to the folder where you downloaded the certificate. If you don't see the .cer file in the list, set the view filter to **All files (*)**. Select the certificate and then select the gear icon next to the **Primary** box.

1. The **Primary Certificate** dialog box appears. The **Subject** and **Thumbprint** fields contain information about the current Azure Sphere tenant and primary root certificate.

### Verify the tenant CA certificate

1. Select the **Generate verification code**.
1. Copy the verification code to the clipboard.

    ![Screenshot that shows how to verify a certificate.](media/verify-certificate.png)

1. Download a validation certificate that proves you own the Azure Sphere tenant CA certificate. Replace **<code\>** in the command with the verification code you copied to the clipboard. From a command prompt, run:

   ```azsphere
   azsphere ca-certificate download-proof --destination ValidationCertification.cer --verification-code <code>
   ```

    The Azure Sphere Security Service signs the validation certificate with the verification code to prove that you own the Certificate Authority (CA).

<!-- ### Verify the tenant's identity -->

1. Return to Azure IoT Central and select **Verify**.

1. When prompted, select the validation certificate that you generated in the previous step. When the verification process is complete, the **Primary Certificate** dialog box displays the **Verified** message.

## Application notes

### Deferred update

Azure Sphere supports deferred updates. Deferred updates are an important production consideration as you will likely want to control when application and OS updates are applied to your Azure Sphere.

The criteria you use to determine the best time to apply updates will be application-specific. For example, it might make sense to apply updates in the early hours of the morning.

The deferred update example included in the CO2 monitor project is a simple time of day calculation. **DeferredUpdateCalculate**  is called when an application or OS update is pending.

The CO2 monitor calculates the local time using UTC (Universal Time Coordinate) plus the local time zone offset. If the calculated local time is between 1 am and 5 am then a zero-minute deferral is requested, and updates are applied. Failing that, a 15-minute deferral extension is requested.

You can't defer updates forever. For an OS update, the maximum deferral is 1440 minutes (24 hours). For an application update, the maximum deferral period is 10,020 minutes (167 hours). To learn more about deferred updates, refer to [Defer device updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/app-development/device-update-deferral).

The following deferred update code is located in main.c of the CO2 monitor project.

```c
/// <summary>
/// Algorithm to determine if a deferred update can proceed
/// </summary>
/// <param name="max_deferral_time_in_minutes">The maximum number of minutes you can defer</param>
/// <returns>Return 0 to start update, return greater than zero to defer</returns>
static uint32_t DeferredUpdateCalculate(uint32_t max_deferral_time_in_minutes, SysEvent_UpdateType type, SysEvent_Status status,
                                        const char *typeDescription, const char *statusDescription)
{
    // UTC +11 is for Australia/Sydney AEDT
    // Set the time_zone_offset to your time zone offset.
    const int time_zone_offset = 11;

    //  Get UTC time
    time_t now = time(NULL);
    struct tm *t = gmtime(&now);

    // Calculate UTC plus offset and normalize.
    t->tm_hour += time_zone_offset;
    t->tm_hour = t->tm_hour % 24;

    // If local time is between 1 am and 5 am defer for zero minutes else defer for 15 minutes
    uint32_t requested_minutes = IN_RANGE(t->tm_hour, 1, 5) ? 0 : 15;

    char utc[40];

    // Update defer requested device twin
    snprintf(msgBuffer, sizeof(msgBuffer), "Utc: %s, Type: %s, Status: %s, Max defer minutes: %i, Requested minutes: %i",
             dx_getCurrentUtc(utc, sizeof(utc)), typeDescription, statusDescription, max_deferral_time_in_minutes, requested_minutes);

    dx_deviceTwinReportValue(&dt_defer_requested, msgBuffer);

    return requested_minutes;
}
```

---

## Set your time zone

1. **Open** the CO2 Monitor project in Visual Studio Code.
1. Locate the **DeferredUpdateCalculate** function in **main.c**.
1. **Update** the DeferredUpdateCalculate function with your time zone offset. The default time zone offset is 10 (Australia/Sydney AEST).

    ```c
    // UTC +10 is for Australia/Sydney.
    // Set the time_zone_offset to your time zone offset.
    const int time_zone_offset = 10;
    ```

1. Review the deferred update time calculation. Deferred updates will be applied between 1 am and 5 am.

    ```c
    // If local time is between 1 am and 5 am defer for zero minutes else defer for 15 minutes
    uint32_t requested_minutes = IN_RANGE(t->tm_hour, 1, 5) ? 0 : 15;
    ```

1. Press <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> to open the Visual Studio Code command palette.
1. Type and select **CMake: Select Variant**, then select **Release**.
1. Press <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> to open the Visual Studio Code command palette.
1. Type and select **CMake: Delete Cache and Reconfigure**.
1. Press <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> to open the Visual Studio Code command palette.
1. Type and select **CMake: Clean Rebuild**.

## Enable deferred updates

1. Delete the existing CO2 monitor application on your Azure Sphere. From the command prompt, run:

    ```powershell
    azsphere device sideload delete
    ```

1. Restart your device. From the command prompt, run:

    ```powershell
    azsphere device restart
    ```

1. Create an Azure Sphere Product. From the command prompt, run:

    ```powershell
    azsphere product create --name CO2Monitor
    ```

1. Move your device to the Field Test group. From the command prompt, run:

    ```powershell
    azsphere device update --device-group "CO2Monitor/Field Test"
    ```

1. From a command prompt, navigate to the **azure-sphere-gallery/CO2_MonitorHealthySpaces/src/out/ARM-Release** folder.
1. Upload the imagepackage to your Azure Sphere tenant. From the command prompt, run:

    ```powershell
    azsphere image add --image co2monitor.imagepackage
    ```

    The output of the image add command will be similar to the following.

    ```text
    Uploading image from file 'co2monitor.imagepackage':
     --> Image ID:       3962c015-8f52-4d85-a043-acbc38f8b4aa
     --> Component ID:   25025d2c-66da-4448-bae1-ac26fcdd3627
     --> Component name: 'co2monitor'
    Removing temporary state for uploaded image.
    Successfully uploaded image with ID '3962c015-8f52-4d85-a043-acbc38f8b4aa' and name 'co2monitor' to component with ID '25025d2c-66da-4448-bae1-ac26fcdd3627'.
    ```

1. Make a note of the Image ID returned from the image add command as you will need it for the next command.
1. Create a new deployment for a device group for the uploaded co2monitor image.
    The following example uses the image ID returned from the previous command for illustrative purposes. Be sure to use **your image ID** when you run the following command.

    ```powershell
    azsphere device-group deployment create --device-group "CO2Monitor/Field Test" --images 3962c015-8f52-4d85-a043-acbc38f8b4aa
    ```

1. Enable your device for cloud testing. From the command prompt, run:

    ```powershell
    azsphere device enable-cloud-test
    ```

It will take approximately 30 seconds for the application to be deployed to your Azure Sphere.

> Note, when you enable your device for cloud testing, you'll not be able to deploy an application to your device from Visual Studio Code. Later, you can reenable local development by running the ```azsphere device enable-development``` command.

---

## Deploy an application update

Next, deploy an update that will be deferred.

1. Ensure the CO2 Monitor solution is open in Visual Studio Code.
1. Open the **main.h** file.
1. Locate the **#define CO2_MONITOR_FIRMWARE_VERSION "3.02"** statement.
1. Update the version number to **3.03**.

    ```c
    #define CO2_MONITOR_FIRMWARE_VERSION "3.03"
    ```

1. Press <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> to open the Visual Studio Code command palette.
1. Type and select **CMake: Delete Cache and Reconfigure**.
1. Press <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> to open the Visual Studio Code command palette.
1. Type and select **CMake: Clean Rebuild**.

### Deploy the update

1. From a command prompt, navigate to the **azure-sphere-gallery/CO2_MonitorHealthySpaces/src/out/ARM-Release** folder.
1. Upload the imagepackage to your Azure Sphere tenant. From the command prompt, run:

    ```powershell
    azsphere image add --image co2monitor.imagepackage
    ```

1. Create a new deployment for a device group for the uploaded co2monitor image. From the command prompt, run:

    ```powershell
    azsphere device-group deployment create --device-group "CO2Monitor/Field Test" --images <the_image_id>
    ```

### Monitor the deferred update status

The IoT Central **Deferred update status** property is updated every time **DeferredUpdateCalculate** is called. You can view the deferred update status and deployed software version from the IoT Central device **About** tab. Select the **expand** icon to expand the page view.

> Note, there may be no status updates for hours. If you get impatient, press the reset button on the Avnet Azure Sphere board. When the device restarts, deferred updates will be applied.

![This image shows the state of the deferred update](media/iot_central_about_tab.png)

### Application deployment status

The following are useful commands when enabling over-the-air application deployments. Note, the Azure Sphere must be USB connected to your computer for these commands to work.

The list-targeted command will display what image package is to be deployed to your device.

```powershell
azsphere device image list-targeted
```

The list-installed command will display what image package has been deployed to your device.

```powershell
azsphere device image list-installed
```

### Application watchdog

Azure Sphere supports an application-level watchdog. The CO2 monitor application includes a watchdog timer. The timer's role is to keep extending the watchdog period.

The watchdog period is set to 60 seconds. If the application fails to extend the watchdog period within 60 seconds, the Azure Sphere OS assumes the application has failed and restarts the application.

Application restarts are recorded in the Azure Sphere tenant error logs. You can view the error report by running the following command from a command prompt.

```powershell
azsphere tenant download-error-report
```

The following code in **main.c** is the watchdog timer callback implementation that extends the watchdog by 60 seconds.

```c
/// <summary>
/// This timer extends the app level lease watchdog
/// </summary>
/// <param name="eventLoopTimer"></param>
static void watchdog_handler(EventLoopTimer *eventLoopTimer)
{
    if (ConsumeEventLoopTimerEvent(eventLoopTimer) != 0)
    {
        dx_terminate(DX_ExitCode_ConsumeEventLoopTimeEvent);
        return;
    }
    timer_settime(watchdogTimer, 0, &watchdogInterval, NULL);
}
```

The application watchdog is disabled by default. If you are debugging the CO2 monitor and pause execution for longer than 60 seconds the Azure Sphere OS thinks the application has failed and will restart it. To enable the watchdog for production, uncomment the call to **start_watchdog** in the **InitPeripheralsAndHandlers** function located in main.c.

```c
static void InitPeripheralsAndHandlers(void)
{
    ...
    // Uncomment for production
    // start_watchdog();
}
```

## This project is evergreen

This project automatically updates the CMake Azure Sphere configuration to match the Azure Sphere SDK you've installed on your computer. This is fine for a sample, but for production applications, setting the Azure Sphere configuration in CMake should be intentional and tested.

In the CMakeLists.txt file, the *auto_generate_azsphere_config* CMake function is called to generate the azsphere_configure_tools and azsphere_configure_api settings.

```makefile
if (EXISTS "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/Tools/cmake/azsphere_config.cmake")

    include(Tools/cmake/azsphere_config.cmake)
    auto_generate_azsphere_config()

else()

    # For information on setting tools revision and target API set see
    # https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/app-development/using-cmake-functions

    azsphere_configure_tools(TOOLS_REVISION "21.07")
    azsphere_configure_api(TARGET_API_SET "10")

endif()
```

For production applications, remove this block and replace it with the following CMake commands.

```makefile
    azsphere_configure_tools(TOOLS_REVISION "<YOUR_TOOLS_VERSION>")
    azsphere_configure_api(TARGET_API_SET "<THE_TARGET_API_SET_YOU_ARE_TESTING_AGAINST")
```

Azure Sphere DevX exit codes

Application level exit codes

## The main event loop

In computer science, the event loop, message dispatcher, message loop, message pump, or run loop is a programming construct that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program.

It works by making a request to some internal or external "event provider" (that generally blocks the request until an event has arrived), and then it calls the relevant event handler ("dispatches the event").

The event-loop may be used in conjunction with a reactor, if the event provider follows the file interface, which can be selected or 'polled' (the Unix system call, not actual polling).

The event loop almost always operates asynchronously with the message originator.

The Azure Sphere platform supports several common POSIX and Linux mechanisms to handle asynchronous events and concurrency, including event loops and POSIX pthreads.

### Asynchronous events and concurrency

[Asynchronous events and concurrency](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/app-development/threads-concurrency)

The Azure Sphere platform supports several common POSIX and Linux mechanisms to handle asynchronous events and concurrency, including event loops and POSIX pthreads.

Event loops are a standard part of most graphical user interfaces and a standard Linux pattern. Azure Sphere event loops are a specific implementation of event loops that allow Azure Sphere applications to receive system notifications such as events related to updates.

The event loop pattern is recommended for the following reasons:

* Azure Sphere event loops are required for managing system events such as OS and application update notifications. You must use event loops to defer device updates.

* Event loops allow for asynchronous programming so that multiple tasks can progress concurrently.

* Event loops minimize memory overhead. Every thread carries the memory overhead of a separate stack. Linux stacks are allocated with virtual memory and grow on-demand to an upper limit so there is no fixed cost. Threads are therefore harder to implement on a constrained system such as the Azure Sphere MT3620 because of the additional resource cost.

* Synchronization between threads is complex and can lead to issues such as deadlocks. Event loops are simpler in this regard.

* Although we recommend using event loops where practicable, if your application requires threads, Azure Sphere supports POSIX pthreads. It is the responsibility of the application to ensure thread-safe execution. Application calls to some applibs functions are thread safe, but others are not, as indicated in the header files. If the header file does not mention thread safety, you should assume that the relevant function or library is not thread safe.

[Event Loop](https://gist.github.com/kassane/f2330ef44b070f4a5fa9d59c770f68e9)

### Event loop implementation in the main entry point for the application

After the call to InitPeripheralsAndHandlers the application runs the event loop forever unless termination is requested by the application or system.

```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{

    ...

    // Main loop
    while (!dx_isTerminationRequired())
    {
        int result = EventLoop_Run(dx_timerGetEventLoop(), -1, true);
        // Continue if interrupted by signal, e.g. due to breakpoint being set.
        if (result == -1 && errno != EINTR)
        {
            dx_terminate(DX_ExitCode_Main_EventLoopFail);
        }
    }

    ...

}
``` -->
