# UdpDebugLog Library

The goal of the socket UdpDebugLog library is to provide a mechanism to view debug data from a device that's not connected to Visual Studio/Visual Studio Code, but is connected to the network.

Note that the socket Log_Debug library uses a UDP socket to send the Log_Debug information, the implementation could be easily modified to send the Log_Debug data to a UART or other interface. Since the library is broadcasting to the local subnet the PC that's running the Log Message viewer application needs to be on the same network.

For more information on Log_Debug usage, see [Log_Debug function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/applibs-log/function-log-debug)

## Prerequisites & Setup

- An Azure Sphere-based device with development features (see [Get started with Azure Sphere](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-sphere/get-started/) for more information).
- Setup a development environment for Azure Sphere (see [Quickstarts to set up your Azure Sphere device](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/install/overview) for more information).

Note that the Azure Sphere High Level application is configured for the 21.01 SDK release.

## How to use

Enable the `add_compile_definitions(USE_SOCKET_LOG)` line in CMakeLists.txt to enable the socket Log_Debug functionality.

* Build and run the [PcUdpLogReceiver](./PcUdpLogReceiver) application on your PC
* Open, build, and run the [SphereUdpLogSender](./SphereUdpLogSender) project in Visual Studio/Code

The AzureSphereUDPDebugConsole application should display the following:

![AzureSphereUDPDebugConsole image](./assets/desktop_client.png)

The PcUdpLogReceiver looks for a received message starting with 'information' or 'info' and displays these strings in Cyan color. Any received message that starts with 'warning' or 'error' will be displayed in Red color.

## Udp and Device Id
UdpDebugLog uses UDP to broadcast to the local network, UDP allows for multiple devices on the same network to broadcast to one or more PC based listening applications.

The Log_Debug message function in UdpLog.c uses the first four bytes of the UDP buffer to hold an ID that can be used to uniquely identify a device that's sending data, the four bytes default to a value of 0xffffffff (which you will see displayed in the PcUdpLogReceiver application).

The PcUdpLogReceiver application defaults to showing Log_Debug data from any Azure Sphere device that's using the SphereUdpLogSender code on the local network, you can filter messages in the PcUdpLogReceiver application by specifying a 4 byte hex value as the parameter to the desktop application - for example:

`PcUdpLogReceiver 466f6f2e`

Note that you will also need to modify lines 46-49 of udplog.c to set the client side 4 byte hex values - the value could be generated from part of the [device MAC address](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/applibs-networking/function-networking-gethardwareaddress), or generated through some other mechanism and persisted in Mutable storage rather than being hard coded in the udplog.c file.

## Example

The sample code in `main.c` has a loop which contains a counter that is incremented once a second, at 5, 10, 15, and 20 seconds a Log_Debug message will be generated, the desktop client application will display the messages if USE_SOCKET_LOG is defined in CMakeLists.txt - if this is not defined then the default Log_Debug behavior is used (output to the Visual Studio/Code debug window).

## Project expectations
